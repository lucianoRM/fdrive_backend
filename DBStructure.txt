Here we specify the structure of the DB. How are things stored and why.

@files.
    maxID -> id (int) //Stores maxid taken by a file in the db. Whenever a new file is added, this values should be incremented by one and give the new id to the new file.

    id -> Json with metadata: //Stores the metadata that belongs to the file with that id
				name
				extension
				last modification time
				last modifying user
				owner
				tags

@users.
    email -> Json with:
				email
				hashed password
				tokens (an array of pairs: token+expirationTime)
				files (an array of objects: idfile (int),
					  						permits ("O" owner or "S" shared),
					  						path ("root", "trash" or "root/<folder>")
					  )
