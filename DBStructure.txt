@files.
    maxID -> id (int) //Stores maxid taken by a file in the db. Whenever a new file is added, this values should be incremented by one and give the new id to the new file.

    <id> -> Json with metadata: //Stores the metadata that belongs to the file with that id
				name
				extension
				lastModified (last modification time)
				lastUser (last modifying user)
				owner
				pathInOwnersAccount
				tags : ["tag1", "tag2", ...]

@users.
    <email> -> Json with:
				email
				hashed password
				name 					(optional)
				pathToProfilePicture	(optional)
				lastLocation
				quota (int that represent the number MB)
				tokens (an array of: {"token": <token>, "expirationTime" : <expTime>} )

@fileStructure
	<email>.<pathOfFolder> - > Json with internal folders (depth = 1) and files:
								folders : ["folder1", ...]
								files : [id1, ...]
	(For any user there will always be "<email>.root", "<email>.shared" and "<email>.trash".)
		Example:
			<email>.root -> { "folders" : ["folder1"] , "files" : [id7, id2] }
			<email>.root/folder1 -> { "folders" : ["folder2"] , "files" : [id1] }
			<email>.root/folder1/folder2 -> { "folders" : [] , "files" : [id10, id3, id67] }
			<email>.shared -> {"folders" : [] , "files": [] }
			<email>.trash -> {"folders" : [] , "files": [] }
		

@searches
	searchtag.<email>.<tag> 			-> 
	searchowner.<email>.<owner> 		-> 		Json with:
