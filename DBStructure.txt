Here we specify the structure of the DB. How are things stored and why.

@files
    files.maxID -> id (int) //Stores maxid taken by a file in the db. Whenever a new file is added, this values should be incremented by one and give the new id to the new file.

    files.<id> -> Json with metadata: //Stores the metadata that belongs to the file with that id
				name
				extension
				lastVersion (int)
				owner
				pathInOwnersAccount
				tags : ["tag1", "tag2", ...]
				versions : { "0" : {	lastModified (last modification time),
										lastUser (last modifying user)	},
							 "1" : ... 
							}
				usersSharedTo : [ "emailUser1", ... ]

@users

	users -> Json with and array of users (emails).

    users.<email> -> Json with:
				email
				hashed password
				name 					(optional)
				pathToProfilePicture	(optional)
				lastLocation			(optional - as it won't have any until it doesn't specify one - this updates anytime the user operates with files)
				quota (int that represent the number MB)
				tokens (an array of: {"token": <token>, "expirationTime" : <expTime>} )

@fileStructure
	<email>.<pathOfFolder> - > Json with internal folders (depth = 1) and files:
								folders : ["folder1", ...]
								files : [id1, ...]
								filesNames : ["name.txt", ...]  // For checking repetition of complete name: name + extension.
								//Not lastModified and lastUser because of complexity moving up between folders.
	(For any user there will always be "<email>.root", "<email>.shared" and "<email>.trash".)
		Example:
			<email>.root -> { "folders" : ["folder1"] , "files" : [id7, id2], "filesNames" : ["fileName7", "fileName2"]}
			<email>.root/folder1 -> { "folders" : ["folder2"] , "files" : [id1], "filesNames" : ["fileName1"] }
			<email>.root/folder1/folder2 -> { "folders" : [] , "files" : [id10, id3, id67] "filesNames" : ["fileName10", "fileName3", "fileName67"]}
			<email>.shared -> {"folders" : [] , "files": [] }
			<email>.trash -> {"folders" : [] , "files": [] }
		

@searches
	searchtag.<email>.<tag> 			-> 
	searchowner.<email>.<owner> 		-> 		Json with:
	searchname.<email>.<name> 			-> 			{ "files" : [ {"id": <id>, "path": "<path>"} , ... ] }
	searchextension.<email>.<extension> ->
